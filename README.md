# MIPs
Movement Improvement Proposals. See [MIP-0](./MIP/mip-0) to get started.

## Deciding whether to Propose
You SHOULD draft and submit an MIP, if any of the following are true:
- Governance for the relevant software unit or process requires an MIP.
- The proposal is complex or fundamentally alters existing software units or processes.

AND, you plan to do the work of fully specifying the proposal and shepherding it through the MIP review process. 

You SHOULD NOT draft an MIP, if any of the following are true:
- You only intend to request a change to software units or processes without overseeing specification and implementation.
- The change is trivial. In the event that an MIP is required by governance, these should usually be handled as either errata or appendices of an existing MIP.
